Hey!

*If you haven't gone trough Documentation or first Read me, let me say a THANK YOU! for buying my template.*

Please, just take a look over Documentation if you're not that good at HTML/CSS/JS in order to have a properly installation.
For light version, change in <head> css link from "style_dark.css" to "style_light.css".


Or you can even contact me. My Themeforest profile:
